by: Leila Bautista (leila.bautista@gov.bc.ca)

The BC AF Trade Tool is an agriculture and food-specific tool to view trade value (e.g., domestic export, imports and trade balance) for all Canadian provinces and territories by country and state destination and commodity type using various classification systems.

There are 2 .rmd files that can be run:

All other files (reference tables, etc.) are stored and in the team's SharePoint site as specified in the above 2 .Rmd files.
